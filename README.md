The repository for Sitian's fall 2013 project.

Sep 3 discussion:
(1) Immediate step for the following week: Familiar with Mininet, set up example networks in WRiPE paper and abstraction paper.
The main goal is to get hands dirty with Mininet, understand its interface (the Pyhton APIs).

(2) The high level goal is to build automation tools that consist of two type of programs:
(2.1) Build translators that parses SDN network configuration files (be it mininet programs or flow table contents) and generate input file to automated reasoning tool (such as TuLip).
(2.2) Develop network abstraction tools, that is a program that manipulates automata (some transition system or state machine).
